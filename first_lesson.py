# How to code for beginners

# Intro Topics
# Why its hard to get started - many languages - many unfamiliar terms - hard to read docs



# Why so many languages - what to learn - how much to learn
# Different languages do different things, simular to construction tools
#   Some use all the time like a hammer
#   Others rarly use and typically for a very specific purpose - ex: jack hammer
#   Learn enough to accomplish the task at hand - maybe quick search for other uses



# Terms
# Class - group of methods
# Method/function/script = program
# instance/instanciate = a copy of (program, variable, )
# Syntax - proper format
# Paramaters - input to method - ex: takes in a number


# Practice problems with docs
# Edabit
# color code
def hello_wordsssss():
    print('Hello World')

hello_wordsssss()

# add2numbersTogether
